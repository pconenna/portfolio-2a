## Portfolio

## Description
This is the second iteration of my portfolio, built with React. It lands on an about page. It contains a link to my GitHub profile, a page to view my past projects, a contct form, and other relevant links. The showcase features the website for Barks of Love Animal Resuce. I have been volunterring for them for over a year, working on the site in a team and alone. I did not originally build the site, but I have helped redesign many parts of the site. I also have been the sole person responsible for content creation, updates, and deletion for over a year. The showcase also contains Movie Mixers. I worked on that in a team. My role was to write all of the front end JavaScript. I also showcase Playtrade, another team project. I built the backend almost entirely by myself and assited with frontend JS and views.

## Usage
Use the nav bar to navigate the different sections of the application. The contact form can recive input, but it is not proccessed, that will be added in the future. The email link will open a mailto to my personal email and the LinkedIn link will take the user to my LinkedIn profile. The link on about section will allow the user to download my resume.
